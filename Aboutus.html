  <img src="BandW.jpg" style="float:left" width="600" height="340"/>
<p>
  Founded by one of the best chef Itachi in the year 1997 it still runs under his guidance.<br><br>
  Inspired by his own search for delicious pizza options,he started to wonder if there was a better way of making pizzas <br>
  He ended up inventing our secret sauce which is loved by millions. <br><br>
  He ran a restaurant in Italy. Preparing food, rushing through descriptions of minute details and garnishing, makes him animated.<br><br> It still continues to make hand-made thin crusts with freshly prepared doughs everyday.<br></br>
  With our secret sauce that comes into picture the taste of the pizza is exotic.<br><br>
  As of today,we have opened outlets all across the world.<br>People leave our restaurant with beautiful smiles.
